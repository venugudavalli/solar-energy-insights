# solar investment insights
A household has invested £7000 on Solar Panels. Electricity bills stands at £180 between Apr &amp; July 2018. Is this investment worth. Let us find out what Data Says?

***Data:*** 

  **Solar Energy:** Solar Energy Data is sourced from OWL Intution (https://www.owlintuition.com/) using household account.
        Data Contains Solar Energy Generated , Exported to the National Grid, Imported in to Household , 
        Total Energy consmed by   household(Dranwn from National Grid and Drawn from Solar system) in cumulative amounts.  
  **Electricity:** Southern Electric (SSE) is the provider of Gas & Electricty to the house hold. 
        The Samrt usage facility will provide us energy consumed in (Wh) for every 30 minutes of a day.
 
**Phase 1:**

    Plot an interactive graphs showing Solar Energy generated, Solar Energy  Exported, Solar Energy Consumed by 
    Household(Imported) and Total energy utilised by property. 
    
    Identify patterns.
    
    Plot should be interactive: 
    
      Hide or show plots by clicking on legend.
      Display units on hovering on data points.
      
    Calculate the Total Energy consumption in Kwh from Smart Solar Data and compare with the 
    actual billed units from SSE.
    
**Technical Components:**

    Python, Pandas, Numpy, bokeh
    Jupyter Notebook
    csv files (Downloaded from (https://www.owlintuition.com/) & (https://my.sse.co.uk/your-account/login)
    Mongodb : To Store the data for further analysis.
